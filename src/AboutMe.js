            <p>Engineer in computer science with practical experience. I was introduced to several 
                different programming languages and frameworks during my bachelor's degree, 
                but Flutter, Java, JavaScript, and HTML-CSS stood out as my favourites. 
                I also used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create applications like a shopping website and a cylinder weight data analyzer.</p>
            <p> Through the completion of a Post Graduate Diploma at ISI College Montreal,
                 I broadened my horizons in these fields. There, I participated in a variety 
                 of projects like dating applications and photo-sharing websites, as well as 
                 created my own projects like a daily pet care app and a weather forecast app.
                  As a result of working on these initiatives, I now feel comfortable giving 
                  presentations and collaborating with others.</p>
